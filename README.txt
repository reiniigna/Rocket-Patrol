I don't have a great excuse for turning this in late. I read in the syllabus that there aren't really strong due dates on assignments, and starting a new job
this quarter alongside the fact that these are my first upper division classes means that the workload is pretty unfamiliar to me. However, I understand
that it's my responsibility to manage my time correctly, and it's something I have been getting professional help with. I'm currently working on catching up on 
everything else, and have been keeping up to date with my team projects. I apologize for the inadequacy and hope that the graders can look past in my circumstances. 
Thank you.
